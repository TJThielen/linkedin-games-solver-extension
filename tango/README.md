# Tango Solver

### TODOs
- [ ] make an actual issue queue instead of this.
- [ ] clear the board when starting solver to avoid mishaps.
- [ ] build out the actual extension popup with some local statistics.
- [ ] in the popup, have a boolean flag for automatically displaying the solution or if it should be hidden and then pop up with the click of a button.
